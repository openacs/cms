basic/cosmetic
---------
list-ize child items (or what to do with it? shouldn't we be able to relate items that already exist?)
better navigation strategy (i.e., "back" links while visiting attributes, rename, delete pages, etc.)
new icon for "clipping" items - new listbuilder checkboxes confuse UI a bit
include description in heading on folder attributes page
inheritance display should not link to "basic item" on its page and should not include the current type (related to navigation strategy)
move all item info (clip check, title, path, etc.) into an include and put in /lib (with ancestors and bookmark)
combine the index pages for templates and items into one and put in /lib? (if they can be made the same)
use page_title in master (possible?)
fix "clear the clipboard" functionality
list-ize user browser
floatclipboard_p working?

plumbing
--------
build up actions list for folder using allow_* vars (i.e., links? new folders?) on sitemap browser
replace [User::getID] with [auth::require_login]
root folder param?
content delivery strategy
remove custom cms permissions system [perm::require]
remove old workflow/add new workflow
fix search
utilize new cr tcl api
use ad_form where appropriate
integrate categories package
ad_page_contract for non-include pages?

questions/ideas
---------
create templates from within folders (in old system)?
generic error page (replace with ad_complain or just pretty up?)
better model for "clipping" items?
how do we get extlinks and other types (if any?) which do not sub-class content_revision into the system?
